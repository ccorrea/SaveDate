![Save the Date][1]

# A Simple Calendar Framework in Swift 

_Save the Date_ is a quick-and-clean calendar view implementation, written in Swift.  

The best way to have users select a date value on an app is by using the familiar calendar layout. The main design goals of _Save the Date_ are simple integration and a small footprint. For the current version of this framework, the number of features is limited. Developers looking for in-depth customization of their calendars should take a look at [CVCalendar][2], [FSCalendar][3] and [JTAppleCalendar][4]. 

**This is work in progress.** I will update this README file and add usage examples when version 1.0 is complete.
