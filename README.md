# A Simple Calendar Framework in Swift 

_Save the Date_ is a Swift framework for displaying simple calendars on your iOS app. 

Until Apple decides to include a calendar view in UIKit, I believe that the best way to have users select a date value on an app is by using the model that most people are already familiar with: The calendar on their wall. The main design goals of _Save the Date_ are simplicity of use and a small footprint. 

With simplicity of use comes a reduced feature set. Developers looking for in-depth customization of their calendars should take a look at [CVCalendar][2], [FSCalendar][3] and [JTAppleCalendar][4]. I hope that _Save the Date_ will be helpful to developers who want a quick-and-clean calendar implementation to plug-in into their apps with minimal effort. 

This README file will be updated with usage example as the framework is developed.
